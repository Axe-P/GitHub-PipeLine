> This project serves as a demonstration of the powerful capabilities of GitHub Actions. It highlights how GitHub Actions can assist the development workflow by automating various tasks, including the remote deployment of a website, and execution of automated tests. By leveraging this CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment) tool, developers can focus more on writing code and less on the manual processes involved in deploying applications.
